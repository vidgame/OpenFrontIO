OpenFront is an online real-time strategy game focused on territorial control and alliance building. Players compete to expand their territory, build structures, and form strategic alliances in various maps based on real-world geography.

### Project Governance

- The project maintainer ([evan](https://github.com/evanpelle)) has final authority on all code changes and design decisions
- All pull requests require maintainer approval before merging
- The maintainer reserves the right to reject contributions that don't align with the project's vision or quality standards

### Contribution Path for New Contributors

To ensure code quality and project stability, we use a progressive contribution system:

1. **New Contributors**: Limited to UI improvements and small bug fixes only

   - This helps you become familiar with the codebase
   - UI changes are easier to review and less likely to break core functionality
   - Small, focused PRs have a higher chance of being accepted

2. **Established Contributors**: After several successful PRs and demonstrating understanding of the codebase, you may work on more complex features

3. **Core Contributors**: Only those with extensive experience with the project may modify critical game systems

### How to Contribute Successfully

1. **Before Starting Work**:

   - Open an issue describing what you want to contribute
   - Wait for maintainer feedback before investing significant time
   - Small improvements can proceed directly to PR stage

2. **Code Quality Requirements**:

   - All code must be well-commented and follow existing style patterns
   - New features should not break existing functionality
   - Code should be thoroughly tested before submission
   - All code changes in src/core _MUST_ be tested.

3. **Pull Request Process**:

   - Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Describe what testing you've performed
   - Be responsive to feedback and requested changes

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Verify your changes work as expected
   - Test on multiple systems/browsers if applicable
   - Document your testing process in the PR

### Communication

- Be respectful and constructive in all project interactions
- Questions are welcome, but please search existing issues first
- For major changes, discuss in an issue before starting work

### Final Notes

Remember that maintaining this project requires significant effort. The maintainer appreciates your contributions but must prioritize long-term project health and stability. Not all contributions will be accepted, and that's okay.

Thank you for helping make OpenFront better!
